# Comparison of HDI and GDP of Country who receive US and World Aid

## Objective

To make a comparison of [Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi) and [Gross Domestic Product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) based on the aid provided by both US and World Aid.

## Purpose

To gather the total financial aid, human development index, and gross domestic product data from 

- [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/index.aspx)

- [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/)

- [USAID](https://explorer.usaid.gov/cd)

With the data for US and World aid to countries, process the information to see the impact it has on GDP and HDI.  After manipulation graph and plot the relevant information.

## Dropbox download

To run the jupyter notebook the csv files will have to be downloaded from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home/US%20and%20World%20GDP%20on%20HDI) due to the large size of the csv files.
